# Metabase Client
A production-ready metabase client to spare you from handling HTTP requests directly.

## Install

```
$ pip install metabasepy
```

## Start

You can provide username and password to authenticate...

```
from metabasepy import MetabaseClient

client = MetabaseClient("http://my-metabase-service.com", username="user", password="pass")
client.auth()
```

... or just provide an already-authenticated token.

```
from metabasepy import MetabaseClient

client = MetabaseClient("http://my-metabase-service.com", token="mytoken1q2w3e4r")
```

**Obs:** Since metabase limits the number of logins made through its API, using the second approach enables you to cache the token and avoid many logins.
